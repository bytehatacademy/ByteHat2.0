        <li>Risk visualization across multi-cloud environments</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>3. Adopt Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security Scanning</h2>
      <p>As more organizations embrace Infrastructure as Code for deploying cloud resources, securing these templates becomes crucial. IaC security scanning tools identify security issues before infrastructure is deployed, shifting security left in the development cycle.</p>
      <p>Best practices include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Integrating IaC scanning into CI/CD pipelines</li>
        <li>Using policy as code to enforce security standards</li>
        <li>Maintaining secure IaC templates and modules</li>
        <li>Regular security audits of infrastructure code</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>4. Implement Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPP)</h2>
      <p>CNAPPs combine multiple cloud security tools into unified platforms that protect applications throughout their lifecycle, from development to runtime.</p>
      <p>Key capabilities include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Container and serverless security</li>
        <li>API security</li>
        <li>Cloud workload protection</li>
        <li>Runtime application self-protection</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>5. Enforce Data-Centric Security</h2>
      <p>As data moves freely between cloud services, security must follow the data rather than focusing solely on perimeter defenses.</p>
      <p>Essential data security measures include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data classification and discovery</li>
        <li>Encryption for data at rest and in transit</li>
        <li>Data loss prevention controls</li>
        <li>Data access governance</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>As cloud environments become more complex, security strategies must evolve to address new challenges. By implementing these five critical security measures, organizations can better protect their cloud infrastructure and data in 2025 and beyond.</p>
      <p>Remember that cloud security is a shared responsibility between cloud providers and customers. While providers secure the underlying infrastructure, customers must secure their data, applications, and access controls.</p>
